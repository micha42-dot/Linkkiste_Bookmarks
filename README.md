## 🚀 Installation Guide

### 1. Setup Backend (Supabase)

Since this is a serverless app, you need to set up your database first.

1.  Create a new project at [database.new](https://database.new).
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in the sidebar.
3.  Paste and run the following script to create the database schema and security policies:

```sql
-- 1. Create the Bookmarks Table
create table bookmarks (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  url text not null,
  title text not null,
  description text,
  tags text[] default '{}',
  folders text[] default '{}',
  notes text,
  to_read boolean default false,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null default auth.uid()
);

-- 2. Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
-- This ensures data is completely private to the logged-in user.
alter table bookmarks enable row level security;

create policy "Users can only see their own bookmarks" on bookmarks for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Users can insert their own bookmarks" on bookmarks for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Users can update their own bookmarks" on bookmarks for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Users can delete their own bookmarks" on bookmarks for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 3. Setup Storage for Avatars
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public) values ('avatars', 'avatars', true);

create policy "Avatar images are publicly accessible" on storage.objects for select using ( bucket_id = 'avatars' );
create policy "Anyone can upload an avatar" on storage.objects for insert with check ( bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated' );
```

4.  Go to **Project Settings** -> **API**.
5.  Copy the **Project URL** and the **`anon` public key**.

### 2. Local Development

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkkiste.git
    cd linkkiste
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Configure environment variables:
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-long-anon-key-string
    ```

4.  Start the app:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 📦 Deployment

You can deploy this for free on Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.

### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)

1.  Push your code to GitHub.
2.  Import the project into Vercel.
3.  In the "Environment Variables" section, add:
    *   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
    *   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4.  Deploy!

> **⚠️ Important:** If the first deployment fails because you forgot the variables, simply adding them isn't enough. You must go to the **Deployments** tab, click the three dots on the failed deployment, and select **Redeploy**.

### Option B: Cloudflare Pages

1.  Log in to Cloudflare and go to **Compute (Workers & Pages)** -> **Pages**.
2.  Click **Connect to Git** and select your repository.
3.  **Build Settings:**
    *   **Framework Preset:** Vite
    *   **Build Command:** `npm run build`
    *   **Output Directory:** `dist`
4.  **Environment Variables:** Add your `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` here.

> **⚠️ Critical:** Vite "bakes" environment variables into the code at build time. If you add the variables *after* the initial build runs (or if the first build fails), you **must** go to **Deployments** -> **Retry deployment** to rebuild the app with the keys included.

## 🔗 How to Save Links (The "Share Target" Feature)

*Okay, here is the honest truth:* Since this is a self-hosted private tool, there is no magic "Install" button in the App Store that automatically sets up sharing. You have to wire it up yourself.

### 🖥️ Desktop (Chrome/Edge/Brave)
This project includes a **local browser extension** (in the `public/extension` folder) that lets you save links with one click.
1.  Go to `chrome://extensions`.
2.  Enable **Developer Mode** (toggle in top right).
3.  Click **Load Unpacked**.
4.  Select the `public/extension` folder inside this project directory.
5.  Click the new icon in your toolbar and enter your App URL (e.g., `https://my-linkkiste.vercel.app`).

### 📱 Mobile (Android/iOS)
There is currently no native "Share to LinkKiste" system menu integration out of the box (requires complex PWA manifest configuration).
1.  Open your deployed app in your mobile browser.
2.  **Add to Home Screen** to install it as a PWA.
3.  To save a link, copy the URL, open LinkKiste, and tap **+ Add**.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

This tool is designed to be **single-user** (or limited user).

1.  **Register your account** immediately after deployment.
2.  Go to your Supabase Dashboard -> **Authentication** -> **Providers** -> **Email**.
3.  Disable **"Confirm email"** (unless you want to set up SMTP).
4.  **CRITICAL:** Once you have created your account, go to **Authentication** -> **Settings** -> **User Signups** and disable **"Allow new users to sign up"**.
    *   This prevents random strangers from using your instance as their database.

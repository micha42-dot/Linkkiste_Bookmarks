## 🚀 Installation Guide

### 1. Setup Backend (Supabase)

Since this is a serverless app, you need to set up your database first.

1.  Create a new project at [database.new](https://database.new).
2.  Navigate to the **SQL Editor** in the sidebar.
3.  Paste and run the following script to create the database schema and security policies:

```sql
-- 1. Create the Bookmarks Table
create table bookmarks (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  url text not null,
  title text not null,
  description text,
  tags text[] default '{}',
  folders text[] default '{}',
  notes text,
  to_read boolean default false,
  user_id uuid references auth.users not null default auth.uid()
);

-- 2. Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
-- This ensures data is completely private to the logged-in user.
alter table bookmarks enable row level security;

create policy "Users can only see their own bookmarks" on bookmarks for select using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Users can insert their own bookmarks" on bookmarks for insert with check (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Users can update their own bookmarks" on bookmarks for update using (auth.uid() = user_id);
create policy "Users can delete their own bookmarks" on bookmarks for delete using (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 3. Setup Storage for Avatars
insert into storage.buckets (id, name, public) values ('avatars', 'avatars', true);

create policy "Avatar images are publicly accessible" on storage.objects for select using ( bucket_id = 'avatars' );
create policy "Anyone can upload an avatar" on storage.objects for insert with check ( bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.role() = 'authenticated' );
```

4.  Go to **Project Settings** -> **API**.
5.  Copy the **Project URL** and the **`anon` public key**.

### 2. Local Development

1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linkkiste.git
    cd linkkiste
    ```

2.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  Configure environment variables:
    Create a file named `.env` in the root directory:
    ```env
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-long-anon-key-string
    ```

4.  Start the app:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## 📦 Deployment

You can deploy this for free on Vercel, Netlify, or Cloudflare Pages.

### Option A: Vercel (Recommended)

1.  Push your code to GitHub.
2.  Import the project into Vercel.
3.  In the "Environment Variables" section, add:
    *   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
    *   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
4.  Deploy!

### Option B: Cloudflare Pages

1.  Connect your GitHub repo to Cloudflare Pages.
2.  **Build Command:** `npm run build`
3.  **Output Directory:** `dist`
4.  **Environment Variables:** Add your `VITE_...` keys here.
5.  **Important:** If the app shows a connection error after deployment, go to **Deployments** -> **Retry deployment** to ensure the variables are baked into the build.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

This tool is designed to be **single-user** (or limited user).

1.  **Register your account** immediately after deployment.
2.  Go to your Supabase Dashboard -> **Authentication** -> **Providers** -> **Email**.
3.  Disable **"Confirm email"** (unless you want to set up SMTP).
4.  **CRITICAL:** Once you have created your account, go to **Authentication** -> **Settings** -> **User Signups** and disable **"Allow new users to sign up"**.
    *   This prevents random strangers from using your instance as their database.
